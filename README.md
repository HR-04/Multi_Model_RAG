# MultiModal Vector Store Index with Llama Index

This project demonstrates how to create a MultiModal Vector Store Index using the `llama_index` library. The project includes embedding text and images using CLIP embeddings and performing retrieval based on both text and image queries.

## Project Description

The project aims to index a directory of documents, including both text and images, and enable retrieval using multi-modal embeddings. This is useful for applications where you need to search and retrieve information based on a combination of text and image queries.
